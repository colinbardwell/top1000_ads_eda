
INITIAL OBSERVATIONS:

Dataframe of 1000 rows, 18 columns. The ad_campaigns_list column is all null, so it gets dropped.

First ad represented started May 2018, latest ad to end was in March 2024. 

Impressions are only represented as a range, so the column is replaced with min_impressions.

The distributions of most numeric variables in the dataset skew heavily to the right, aside from min_impressions.

The highest represented impression range is >=10,000,000, where 40% of advertisements in the dataset fall.

37.6% of advertisements utilize age targeting (not including those that target all age ranges)

5.8% of advertisements utilize gender targeting (not including those that target all genders represented)

87.2% of advertisements utilize geo targeting (whether included regions or excluded)

Ad types represented are 54.8% VIDEO, 36.2% TEXT, 9.0% IMAGE

Advertisements that do not utilize geo targeting tend to have advertisers that spend more money amongst all campaigns on average.

Higher value ad campaigns tend to start more frequently at the beginning of the year, and tend not to end in April or May.

Minimum impressions for TEXT ads on average are much lower than that of IMAGE or VIDEO ads by nearly an order of magnitude.

IMAGE ads consistently fall in the highest impression range, while VIDEO ads have a wider distribution of impressions values.
